The code contained within calcc.py is an extended
version of the calc.py that is included with the PLY package. The extension
includes % and // operators, as well as support for lists and operators between
lists of the same size. This version creates assembly language code than can
be run through JCoCo to give the output of the program.

Partial solution given by Dr. Sudarshan Chawathe on the COS 301 course 
discussion boards. Solution expanded upon and completed by Matthew Virgin.

5 sample inputs are given in in101.tx through in105.txt
the .casm files generated with "python calcc.py < in10i.txt > cc10i.casm"
are named cc101 through cc105
The outputs generated by running these casm files through JCoCo can be found in
out101.txt through out105.txt

One thing to note is that in103.txt ends with an undefined "no", meaning that
out103.txt doesn't print no's value because there is nothing to print. JCoCo
throws an error here if you try to run cc103.casm through it. 

in105 showcase's the program's ability to handle grouped expression and the
unary minus operator
